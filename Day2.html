    <h1>Day2 - HTML Basics</h1>
    <p>
      After the whirlwind of Day 1, I was eager to get to grips with the
      specifics of coding, and HTML seemed like the natural starting point. As a
      beginner, it was exciting to imagine all the possibilities of what I could
      create — websites, forms, and layouts — just by understanding the building
      blocks of HTML. Armed with a cheat sheet I'd created and the resources I'd
      found, I dove straight into the world of HTML.
    </p>
    <h3>Choosing My Resources</h3>
    <p>
      To begin, I turned to resources like
      <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">Roadmap.sh</a> and a comprehensive YouTube
      video that walked through the basics of HTML. Roadmap.sh provided a clear
      structure, outlining what I needed to focus on, while the video helped
      break things down into manageable sections. Together, these resources were
      helpful, but despite having such clear guidance, something still didn't
      feel quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      first thing I did was watch the video on HTML basics
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u4q2vDLiU0">
        (here's the one I followed)</a
      >. It covered essential concepts like tags, attributes, and the structure
      of a basic webpage. As I followed along, I found myself copying the code
      and typing it into my editor without really understanding the “why” behind
      each line. By the end of it, I could technically build a webpage — I'd
      learned how to create headings, paragraphs, links, and images — but I
      still felt like I hadn't truly grasped the material.
    </p>
    <h3>Building My Cheat Sheet</h3>
    <p>
      To help reinforce my learning, I created a cheat sheet. I wrote down all
      the tags, attributes, and a few examples of how to use them. Writing it
      all out was useful, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't really
      learning. I had memorised the syntax, sure, but the concepts didn't feel
      ingrained. I wasn't confident in my ability to apply what I'd learned in
      real-world scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with the cheat sheet as a guide, I didn't feel like I was truly
      learning — just following along. It was like I was learning the how
      without understanding the why. I could explain that <strong>h1</strong> is
      for the main heading, but I didn't fully understand why I'd use it in a
      particular situation or why certain tags need to be nested within others.
      There was a gap between just copying code and really internalising it.
    </p>
    <h3>The Frustration of "Following Along"</h3>
    <p>
      At this point, I realised a major challenge of learning to code:
      <strong>passive learning</strong>. Just watching or copying code without
      actively engaging with it doesn't lead to true understanding. It felt like
      I was just going through the motions, hoping it would click eventually. I
      needed to break away from this passive approach if I wanted to move
      forward.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>By the end of Day 2, I had learned some important lessons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u><strong>Passive learning isn't enough:</strong></u> Watching
        tutorials and following along is helpful, but true learning comes from
        engaging with the material. Trying to build your own projects, even if
        they're simple, is one of the best ways to reinforce your understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          <strong
            >Cheat sheets are useful, but not a substitute for
            understanding:</strong
          >
        </u>
        Having a reference guide is great when you need it, but it's the context
        and reasoning behind each tag and attribute that matter most.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>
      Although Day 2 was filled with frustration and doubt at times, it was also
      the day I began to truly understand the basics of HTML. It wasn't about
      memorising code — it was about applying it and seeing how it fits
      together. I still have a lot to learn, but the foundation is now in place,
      and I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the language
