    <h1>Day3 - Codecademy - Tutorial Hell?</h1>
    <p>
      After gaining a solid grounding in HTML over the past couple of days, I
      was ready to take the next step in my coding journey. My curiosity led me
      to Codecademy, a popular platform for learning coding interactively. The
      site offered a structured way to learn, with a combination of theory,
      exercises, and quizzes. I thought it would be the perfect resource to
      continue building on my HTML knowledge. However, as I spent more time
      working through the lessons, I started to feel like I was getting stuck in
      something I had heard a lot about — "tutorial hell."
    </p>
    <h3>The Allure of Codecademy</h3>
    <p>
      When I first logged into Codecademy, I was impressed by its organised
      structure and user-friendly design. The interactive lessons helped me
      grasp the basic concepts quickly. I was introduced to new elements of HTML
      and CSS, including more advanced topics like classes, IDs, and the
      structure of a webpage. The exercises were great for reinforcing the
      theory, and I felt like I was learning more about how different tags and
      styles worked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, it was motivating. I'd complete a module, get a sense of
      accomplishment from the small wins, and then move on to the next lesson.
      However, as I continued through the lessons, a pattern started to emerge.
      While the theory and exercises were useful, I wasn't retaining the
      knowledge in the way I had hoped. I found myself simply following along
      with the steps, ticking off boxes without truly understanding the
      reasoning behind them.
    </p>
    <h3>Falling into the Trap of Tutorial Hell</h3>
    <p>
      I soon realised that I had fallen into what many developers call "tutorial
      hell." This term refers to the frustrating cycle where you constantly
      follow tutorials and exercises without ever going beyond them. It's easy
      to get stuck in a loop of completing tutorial after tutorial, but without
      applying the knowledge to real projects, you aren't truly learning
    </p>
    <p>
      At that point, I realised something crucial: While Codecademy had a wealth
      of information, it wasn't giving me the opportunity to explore the
      material independently. I wasn't able to take what I was learning and
      create something of my own. I wasn't facing the challenges of solving
      problems on my own — I was just repeating what the tutorial told me to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood the steps, but I didn't fully comprehend how or why I was
      using them in context. The knowledge wasn't becoming ingrained, and I felt
      frustrated. I was learning how to code, but I wasn't learning how to think
      like a coder.
    </p>
    <h3>The Need for Guided Projects</h3>
    <p>
      It became clear to me that what I needed was a guided project — something
      that would teach me the basics but then challenge me to go off on my own
      and solve problems independently. The idea of working through a project
      where I could apply my knowledge, test my skills, and confront my
      weaknesses sounded like the perfect solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A guided project would allow me to see the big picture, understand how
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fit together, and create something tangible.
      After completing a guided project, I'd be better equipped to strike out on
      my own and continue experimenting, making mistakes, and learning from
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I began my search for such a project. I needed a balance of structure
      and independence — something to help me get started and then let me take
      the reins. What I really craved was a task that didn't hold my hand every
      step of the way, but also didn't leave me in the dark without direction. A
      project that would let me learn by doing, rather than just by following.
    </p>
    <h3>Shifting my Focus</h3>
    <p>
      While Codecademy was certainly useful, I realised I needed to strike a
      better balance between guided learning and hands-on practice. I decided to
      take a step back from the exercises and focus on creating a small project
      — a personal webpage or a simple website design, something manageable but
      with enough freedom to make it my own. I wanted to see how the theory I
      had learned could translate into actual design and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was simple: I would start with a basic layout, like a portfolio
      or blog page, and use the knowledge I had gained so far to create the
      structure. But I wouldn't rely solely on tutorials. I would work through
      the challenges myself, using my cheat sheet and other resources only when
      I got stuck. This would force me to apply my knowledge and fill in the
      gaps where I had fallen short.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Day 3 brought a lot of clarity. I learned that learning to code isn't just
      about following along with tutorials — it's about applying what you learn
      to real-world projects. Here's what I took away from the day:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u><strong>Tutorials are useful, but they aren't enough</strong></u>
        It's easy to get caught up in the comfort of following step-by-step
        instructions. While tutorials can teach you syntax and basic principles,
        real learning happens when you apply your knowledge to solve problems on
        your own.
      </li>

      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>Guided projects offer the right balance:</strong>
        </u>
        The best way to move forward is by finding projects that provide a bit
        of structure but also challenge you to think critically and work
        independently. A guided project can help you build confidence and
        reinforce what you've learned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>Learning is messy:</strong>
        </u>
        It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that learning is a smooth,
        linear process. But in reality, it's full of trial and error. The more I
        struggled through challenges and mistakes, the more I began to
        understand how things worked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>The importance of independence:</strong>
        </u>
        The real learning comes when you stop relying on others to tell you what
        to do and start figuring things out yourself. It's through this process
        of problem-solving that you begin to internalise the skills you need.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>
      Day 3 was a wake-up call. While Codecademy offered a lot of useful
      information, it wasn't enough to build the skills I needed to truly move
      forward. I'm now more focused on working through projects that allow me to
      apply my knowledge, even if they involve some trial and error. I'm looking
      for projects that give me the basics and then let me go off on my own,
      face challenges, and work through my mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's clear that in order to truly learn, I need to move beyond just
      following along and start building something real. I'm excited to see how
      these next projects help me grow as a developer — and I'm ready to take on
      the next challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 3 was an important step in my coding journey. I've realised that
      tutorials have their place, but the real learning begins when you start
      building and problem-solving on your own. I'm ready to take the next leap,
      and I can't wait to see what I'll create with the knowledge I've gained so
      far.
