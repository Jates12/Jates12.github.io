    <h1>Day4 - Guided Project</h1>
    <p>
      After a few days of absorbing HTML, CSS, and diving into some helpful
      tutorials, I felt like I was finally ready to put my knowledge to the
      test. Day 4 marked a major milestone in my coding journey: I completed my
      first real project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project itself came from a YouTube video I watched called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA&t=19s"
        >How to Build a Website from Scratch (Beginner Tutorial)”</a
      >. The video not only gave me a solid understanding of the steps needed to
      build a website but also provided me with all the materials to get started
      — a basic CSS stylesheet and some reference images. The project wasn't
      overly complex, but it was exactly what I needed to take the next step and
      prove to myself that I could apply everything I had learned so far.
    </p>
    <h3>A Solid Foundation and New Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The video was well-structured and explained the project clearly. It laid
      out the framework, but it didn't hold my hand too much. The tutorial
      didn't walk me through every single line of code. Instead, it focused on
      teaching me how to use the resources (the stylesheet and images) to create
      a simple webpage layout. For the first time, I felt like I was really
      building something from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching the video, I could already tell that it was going to be a bit of
      a challenge. There were aspects of the project that I hadn't yet explored,
      particularly some new CSS properties that I hadn't encountered before.
      These new concepts pushed me to expand my knowledge beyond what I already
      knew. I could already tell this would be a valuable opportunity to grow.
    </p>
    <h3>Building the Project</h3>
    <p>
      With the materials ready and the basic structure in mind, I set off to
      create the project. I opened my text editor, created a new folder for my
      project files, and started working with the HTML and CSS. The first step
      was to structure the page with headings, paragraphs, and images, following
      the reference images provided. These reference images gave me a visual
      guide, but I had to figure out how to get the layout just right using the
      tools I had learned so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real work began when I tried to style the page using CSS. At this
      point, I was building on what I had already learned, but I encountered
      several challenges. Some CSS properties I hadn't yet come across in my
      studies started popping up, and I had to pause the video a few times to
      look up their meanings and how to use them correctly. At times, I felt a
      bit lost, but I wasn't about to give up. I knew that these were the
      moments that would help me grow as a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest hurdle was aligning and styling the images and text in the way
      they appeared in the reference images. The CSS I was working with had some
      complex properties for positioning and spacing, which I hadn't mastered
      just yet. I made a lot of mistakes, tried different approaches, and
      reloaded the page over and over again as I adjusted the code. But with
      each error, I learned a little bit more, figuring out which styles worked
      and why.
    </p>
    <h3>Trial and Error: The Path to Success</h3>
    <p>
      The process wasn't smooth. It took a few hours, and I hit roadblocks along
      the way. Some elements didn't align properly, some text was too large, and
      some images looked out of place. But every time I made a mistake, I
      learned how to fix it. Through trial and error, I began to understand how
      HTML and CSS work together to create a webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time I faced an issue, I reminded myself that it was part of the
      learning process. I stopped relying solely on the tutorial and began
      experimenting with my own solutions. After some time, I managed to get the
      layout to look just right, with the images aligned properly and the text
      flowing neatly. Slowly but surely, the project started to come together.
    </p>
    <h3>The Moment of Achievement</h3>
    <p>
      After a few hours of hard work and countless adjustments, I finally
      completed the project. I looked at the finished webpage, and I couldn't
      help but feel a sense of pride. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine. I had
      used the tools I'd been given — the CSS stylesheet, the reference images,
      and the knowledge I had gathered over the past few days — to create a
      fully functioning webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, I saw how all the pieces fit together. It was a simple
      project, but it felt like a huge achievement. The sense of accomplishment
      was massive, not just because I had completed the project, but because I
      had actively learned through doing. This was the moment when I realised
      that I was no longer just following tutorials; I was using my knowledge to
      create something real.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>Looking back on Day 4, here are the key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u><strong>Learning by Doing:</strong></u>
        This project reinforced that the best way to truly learn is by creating
        something yourself. The theory and exercises are important, but the
        hands-on experience is what truly solidifies the knowledge.
      </li>

      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>Trial and Error Is Essential:</strong>
        </u>
        I encountered a lot of mistakes along the way, but each one was an
        opportunity to learn. By facing challenges head-on, I was able to solve
        problems and improve my skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>CSS Is a Powerful Tool:</strong>
        </u>
        Even though I've only scratched the surface of CSS, this project showed
        me just how powerful it can be when used effectively. I had to dig
        deeper into CSS properties, and it felt great to begin to understand how
        they can be used to manipulate the layout and design of a webpage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>
          <strong>Don't Be Afraid to Struggle:</strong>
        </u>
        This project wasn't easy. There were plenty of times when I felt
        frustrated or confused. But those struggles are an important part of the
        learning process. It's through these challenges that real growth
        happens.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>
      Day 4 was a pivotal moment in my coding journey. Not only did I complete
      my first project, but I also realised that the true learning begins when
      you start applying your knowledge and problem-solving on your own. While
      the project wasn't perfect, it was a significant milestone — one that gave
      me the confidence to continue moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm excited for what comes next. With the foundations in HTML and CSS in
      place, I feel ready to take on bigger projects, experiment with new
      techniques, and keep building my skills. Day 4 taught me that coding is
      about persistence, problem-solving, and, above all, enjoying the process
      of learning and creating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at the project now, I'm proud of how far I've come. What started
      as a basic set of HTML and CSS lessons has grown into real, tangible
      skills that I can use to create. I can't wait to see where this journey
      takes me next! Im by no means anwyhere near the end of my learning, i know
      the hard parts are yet to come but im really enjoying throwing myself into
      something new!
