    <h1>Day5 - Solo Projects</h1>
    <p>
      Day 5 was a major turning point in my coding journey — it was the day I
      finally took off the training wheels and created my first
      <strong>solo projects</strong>. Up until now, I had been following along
      with tutorials, completing exercises, and recreating websites with some
      guidance. But today, I took everything I had learned and put it into
      practice on my own, with no step-by-step instructions to follow. The
      results? My first personal projects: a <strong>CV website</strong> and the
      <strong>blog you're reading right now</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>The First Solo Challenge: My Online CV</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to create an online CV for my first project. This was a simple
      and practical way to combine everything I had learned so far — HTML for
      structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of personal flair to make it stand
      out. It wasn't about being fancy; it was about applying the knowledge I
      had gained to build something useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process was refreshing. I started from scratch with a blank file, just
      me, my code editor, and the ideas in my head. I made decisions about the
      layout, created the structure with headings, sections, and lists, and used
      CSS to make it look neat and presentable. There were definitely some
      hiccups along the way, but I felt a real sense of accomplishment as I saw
      it all come together
    </p>
    <p>
      The best part? I now have a live, online CV that I can show off to
      potential employers or anyone who might want to know more about me. And
      it’s hosted on GitHub, which is another big win in itself. I took the leap
      from “just learning” to creating something real and usable — and I’m
      really proud of the result. You can check it out in my
      <a href="https://github.com/Jates12/Online-CV">GitHub repository.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>The Blog - A New Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Alongside the CV, I decided to create this blog. Writing about my journey
      is not only a way to track my progress, but it’s also a project that
      allows me to practice my skills in a slightly different way. A blog has a
      different structure and style compared to a CV, and I was excited to build
      it from scratch, deciding how I wanted it to look and function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog doesn’t look fancy or polished — it's simple and functional, and
      that's exactly how I wanted it. I created basic layouts, added some
      styling to make it more readable, and ensured it was structured correctly
      using HTML and CSS. Sure, I had to Google a few things along the way —
      there were a couple of syntax errors and little problems that popped up —
      but every time I ran into a roadblock, I felt more confident in figuring
      out how to solve it.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning on My Own: No Training Wheels</h3>
    <p>
      What made Day 5 so special wasn’t the fact that I completed two projects,
      but the fact that I did it on my own. For the first time, I wasn't relying
      on tutorials or structured lessons. I had no specific guide telling me
      what to do next. I just started coding, thinking about the design,
      experimenting with different approaches, and figuring out what worked. It
      was incredibly empowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I didn’t completely avoid external resources. When I ran into a
      problem I couldn’t solve, Google became my best friend. Whether it was a
      tricky CSS issue or a small mistake in my HTML, I turned to Google to help
      me troubleshoot. Searching for solutions helped me understand my errors,
      break down the problem, and implement the right fix. It was like having a
      little bit of extra help, but still working through the issues
      independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience really made me realise how much I’ve learned over the past
      few days. The ability to search for and solve problems is an essential
      part of being a developer, and it's something I feel much more confident
      about now.
    </p>
    <h3>The Buzz of Creating Something of My Own</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most exciting things about today was the feeling of
      accomplishment. As I was working on these projects, I couldn’t help but
      feel a sense of pride with each step. The more I built, the more I started
      to understand how all the pieces fit together. It wasn’t just about coding
      — it was about problem-solving, creativity, and persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I hit a roadblock, I didn’t get frustrated or give up. Instead, I saw
      it as an opportunity to learn, to push through and figure out how to make
      my project better. And when the final result came together, it felt like a
      huge win.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the real magic of coding: the sense of
      <strong>creating</strong> something from scratch. I know my projects
      aren’t the most complex or advanced, but they’re mine. I took everything
      I’ve learned and applied it to something real, and that’s what makes it so
      rewarding.
    </p>
    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>
      As I look back at Day 5, I can’t help but feel excited for what’s to come.
      I’ve completed my first solo projects, but this is only the beginning. The
      skills I’ve gained so far are just the foundation, and now it’s time to
      build on them. Every project, no matter how simple, is another step
      forward in becoming a better developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best part? I’m hooked. There’s something about the process of
      building, experimenting, and solving problems that is incredibly
      satisfying. Even though my projects are basic right now, I can feel myself
      getting better with each line of code. I’m learning, and I’m loving the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 5 was a turning point for me. It wasn’t just about finishing a project
      — it was about taking ownership of my learning and building something I
      can be proud of. I can’t wait to continue this journey, learn more, and
      keep that buzz going.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking ahead to Day 6 and beyond, I’m ready to take on new challenges,
      experiment with more complex designs, and continue putting everything I’ve
      learned into practice. The excitement of creating something from scratch
      is what keeps me going, and I can’t wait to see what I’ll create next!
